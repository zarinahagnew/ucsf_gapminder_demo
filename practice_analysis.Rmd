## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{python hello} 
print "hello hello"
```

moo

```{r plotting gapminder}
gapM = read.table(file = "output/combined_gapMinder.tsv", sep = "\t", header = TRUE) # first 
plot(gapM$pop)
```

```{python, engine.path="/usr/bin/python"}
import sys
print sys.version
```

/usr/bin/python



## I DID THIS
this is a plot of sum dataz

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
